## Size of dataset

Type|Size|
|---|---|
|Training dataset| 2500|
|Test dataset| 2500|
|Total | 5000|

Each dataset consists of work done by 50 authors and the same set of authors 
are in both datasets.

This particular dataset (20news-18828.tar.gz) was not split into training and test dataset, so
it was split into two sets for these testing by me.

Type|Vocabulary|Epoch|Loss| Training Accuracy | Test Accuracy | Machine used |

|TF-IDF + Naive Bayes | NA | NA | NA | NA | 66.76% | Mac |
